Hey over that side good morning my angel darling. Hope you had a nice long (ish) sleep and lots of lovely dreams and dream George was nice to you for a change. Good job smashing it at school every day sweet, day 3 week 2 started! So mega proud of you and I love you and miss you so much. Looking forward to having you back home and we can start the health kick together. You're my inspiration and my purpose. I love you so much, have a good morning chicken xxxxxx
