Hey good morning over that side over there my chicken angel. Hope you had a mega nice and peaceful sleep and are raring to go for the last day away from me and your home this week. Can't wait to have you back in your safe space and I will crawl up into my space too. I love you so so much and we can do anything in the world that we want between us! Hope your tummy is feeling better now darling, drive mega safe to school and I'll catch up with you at some point. Love you to the sky and back so many times xxxxxx
