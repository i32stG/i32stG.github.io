Hey there good morning my chicken darling charling. Sorry this weekend was a bit turbulent, that's never what I want with our limited time together. I do love you so much and I just want you to be the happiest girl in the world. Sorry for not putting the effort in sometimes, you deserve so much better. We're gonna get through anything that comes our way and have such a happy future together I just know it. You're my mega chegs number one and I don't know what I'd do without you. Hope you have a great day at school today and the wee bawbags better behave themselves or they'll have me to deal with. I love you to the sky and back x5. Drive safe my angel. Thanks for always being you xxxxxx
