Hey there good morning Mrs teachuw, hope you had the best quality of sleep with amazing dreams. Just to let you know I'm so proud of you every day darling, I know it must be very tough juggling everything at the moment and I want to support you in any way I can. You're my angel and my darling and I want to look after you so let me know if I can help. I love you so so mega much sweetness, drive safe to school and I'll let you know how many teeth I've had removed later on. Sending all my love xxxxxx
