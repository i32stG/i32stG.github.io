Hey sweet happy Friday text. Sorry you've not had a Friday text in a while, I guess Fridays aren't good days for us recently. I'm sorry for not trying as hard as I should and as hard as you deserve in everything we do. You really do deserve better than that and I don't expect forgiveness since I can't really forgive myself even though it keeps happening. I don't want to keep putting you through my shittiness and poor decisions. You are my number one and I can't think of spending my life with anyone else. I do love you all the way to the sky and back more times than anyone can count.
