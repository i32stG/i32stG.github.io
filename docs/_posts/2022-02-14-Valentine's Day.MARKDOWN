Hey darling over there good morning. Hope you managed to get a wonderful sleep with lovely dreams. Happy Valentine's Day! I'm sorry for this weekend and that we didn't get to spend our limited time doing exciting fun things. I do love you so much and I do mean everything I wrote in your card. I hope you managed to get your morning coffee darling. Have a good morning at school and drive safe. Love you like you miss you fancy you. Speak to you at lunch time xxxxxx
