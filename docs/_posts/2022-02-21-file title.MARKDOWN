Good morning sweet. I'd just like to say I love you so much and you're always my one. I know I've got some changes to make and sons serious thinking to do, and I do really hope I can do it as quickly as possible. I don't like making you upset and it really does break my heart that you can't trust me and that I've become toxic. That's never what I should be. I'm sorry for causing you this pain and hurt. I hope you got some sleep and have a good day at school. Drive safe darling. I love you xxxxxx
