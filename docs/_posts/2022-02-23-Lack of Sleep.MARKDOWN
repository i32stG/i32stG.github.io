title:  Lack of Sleep
---
Hello just over there good morning this morning my darling angel. I hope you got some good sleep yesterday evening! In all seriousness sweet this can't be healthy for you, we've got to try and figure out a better way of getting this work done. I like it a lot when you get sleep so I'm biased but this is next level. I love you so so much and I can't bare to watch you struggle with stress and anxiety and I don't like it. Make sure to drive so mega safe my darling, even if it means getting even more coffee to get you through it. Let me know when you're at school safe please. I love you and miss you and am keeping your spot nice and warm for you. You're my one xxxxxx
