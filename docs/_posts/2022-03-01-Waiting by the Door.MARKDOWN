Hey there good morning over there my darling. That's not the best news in the world for us but I'm getting used to waiting by the door for you sweet and I still love you to the sky and back x5 and we'll make it work like we always do. Hope you managed to get a nice long sleep with wonderful dreams. Good luck with your last day of full responsibility for this placement, almost finished it all now! Drive mega safe to school please and have a good day with the wee bawbags. I love you so much and I miss you tons and millions. You're my number one and you're my angel xxxxxx
