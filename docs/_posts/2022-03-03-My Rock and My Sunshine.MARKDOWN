Hey darling good morning over there over that side my sweetness. Hope you had a nice long sleep and got all the work done you needed.  I want you to know I really do love and miss you and as much as I might need to tell my face that, that doesn't take away from it being so true. You're my one and my rock and my sunshine, and I wouldn't be able to do it without you sweet. Drive safe to school darling and have a good day with the wee bawbags. I love you so so much xxxxxx
