Hey darling charling over that side. Just a quick morning text to let you know I'm alive and ok. Hope you managed to get some good sleep. Have a good final day at milesmark, so proud of you for smashing placement 2! You really are Mrs teachuw. I love you so so much thank you for always looking after me sweet. You're my numero Uno ungunga. Drive safe and I'll speak to you later. Love you xxxxxxxxxxxx
