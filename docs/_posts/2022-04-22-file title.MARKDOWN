Hey darling just over there good morning my angel. Hope you didn't end up staying up too late last night and sorted out your work for school today. Fingers crossed it all goes well for you I'm sure it will Mrs teachuw. Don't let money stress you out sweet I'll sort it all out for the moment we're a team ok? We'll get through this together and it will all work out in the end I know it. I love you so much my darling angel. Good job for smashing your first week. Not too many more to go until you're done there. So proud of you. Sending all my love to you sweet, drive safe and let me know how your day goes over there. You're my one xxxxxx
