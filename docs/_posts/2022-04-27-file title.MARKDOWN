Hey darling over there on day 3 of week 2. Just a quick one to let you know I love you so much and I can't wait to have you back home where you belong. So proud of you as always for smashing it every day. Good luck with the kids today my angel and good luck with your lesson! I love you my chicken, drive safe as safe xxxxxx
