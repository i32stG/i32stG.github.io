Hey there darling sweetness, hope you're having a nice sleep and lovely dreams just there next to me bed. I just wanted to let you know how much I love you and regardless of how many tough days and tough weeks come our way, we'll have each other to lean on and get through it together. We can do anything as a team my sweetness. Sorry that you've had a tough week, I'm glad you're home for the weekend and we'll try to have a nice chilled one. I love you so much darling you're my one and my sunshine and my rock. Sleep tight my angel xxxxxx
