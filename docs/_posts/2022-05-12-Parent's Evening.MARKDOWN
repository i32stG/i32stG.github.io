Hey there my Mrs teachuw, hope you have an amazing day at school and all the wee bams behave for you today or else I'll sort them out. Enjoy parents evening if possible, or at least do some learning from it. I love you so so much, drive safe and I'll speak to you later when I'm still missing you so much. Nice to love you my angel xxxxxx
