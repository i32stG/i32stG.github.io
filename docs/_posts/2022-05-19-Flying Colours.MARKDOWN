Hey good morning sweetness. Just wanted to let you know how incredibly proud I am of you. You've absolutely smashed the last year at uni and at school and you 100% deserve to pass with flying colours. I'm sorry there wasn't as much fanfare as you would have liked or as you would have given to anyone else yesterday. Can I make it up to you by taking you to the fort on Friday and we'll choose you a nice treat? I love you so much darling, have a good day at school and drive safe my angel. Nice to love you xxxxxx
