Hey there just next to me my darling angel, just wanted to send you a small bit late Friday text. Thanks for being amazing this weekend and looking after me and Oliver, we had such a great time and it's all thanks to you and your efforts. I know Oliver isn't very effusive (probably like someone else you know) but I know for certain he loves you loads and loads and really appreciates your company. I love you so much my sweetness and every morning I look at you and feel like the luckiest boy in all of greater Glasgow (and the world). You're my sunshine and my inspiration and my rock and my one. I love you xxxxxx
