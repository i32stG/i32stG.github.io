Hey darling charling chicken sweet just over there next to me, hope you've had a nice week since your last Friday text. I know life has been a bit busy with work and trying to save money at the moment, but we're so close to being over that hill and I can't wait. You're my number one and my angel and we're going to have so much happiness and joy in our lives. Thanks for looking after me always, I'm the luckiest boy in the whole of Lanarkshire and the world. I love you so much my darling. Sleep well bound xxxxxx
