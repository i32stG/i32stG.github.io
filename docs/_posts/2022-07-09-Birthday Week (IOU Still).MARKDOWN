title:  Birthday Week (IOU Still)
---
Hey darling just next to me in bed over just here my darling angel. I hope you've had an amazing birthday week (given the circumstances). Sorry you're birthday day wasn't as good as last year, and we didn't manage to get you some fancy shoes or a bag. I'm gonna get you them for sure, you deserve all the treats in the world. Thank you for always being an amazing person and always being my rock and my sunshine. I don't know how I would manage without you my angel. I'm mega looking forward to having a trip away just about anywhere with you sweet, you're the only person I wanna spend time with. Hope you get a good long sleep and a nice lie in while I'm racing. Love you to the moon and back so many times. Sleep well bound xxxxxx
