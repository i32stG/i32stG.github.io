Hey there my darling sweetness angel. I hope you've had a good week and especially a good day, spending some time having a look at engagement rings with me and your mum. I'm so happy we found something perfect for you and it could be more beautiful and shining, just like my darling. I'm always looking forward to the next moment of our life together, even if that's just one day at a time in my mind sometimes. You're my one and I'm the luckiest boy in the whole of Lanarkshire (and the world). I love you so mega much and you didn't even have to remind me of the Friday text good job me! Love you my angel, come and get some sleep soon xxxxxxxxxxxx
