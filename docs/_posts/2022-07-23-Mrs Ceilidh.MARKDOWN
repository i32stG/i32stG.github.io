Hey darling just next to me just here in our new pink bed sheets. I hope you've had a great night tonight with me and Aidan and Jonny doing a mad ceilidh. You're my Mrs ceilidh every day and thank you so much for always being so good with my family. I love you so mega much and I can't wait to wake up next to you tomorrow and think wowee no way that's my angel I'm the luckiest boy in the world. Get some good sleep and we'll have a great day at a loch tomorrow. You're my rock and my bester and the brightest star in my sky. Sleep well bound xxxxxx
