Hey darling, I hope you've had a good week spending some time with and choosing our new baby. I can't wait for the next chapter of our life with the cutest pup in the world. Thanks for being my rock and thanks for being the best dog mum I could hope and wish for. You're my one, always. I love you so much xxxxxx
