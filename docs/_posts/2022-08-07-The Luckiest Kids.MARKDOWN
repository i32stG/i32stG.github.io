Hey there just next to me my darling sweetness sweetheart. I want to say a massive congratulations and that I'm so proud of you for getting through your summer job to help support us and our future. You're going into the next step of your career now and I know for certain you'll smash it and those kids couldn't be any luckier they have no idea how privileged they are to have you. You're my mega one, my dog momma, my angel sweet and my home. Thanks for everything you do for us. I love you so so much and I hope you get a nice long sleep with the best dreams. Love you darling xxxxxx
