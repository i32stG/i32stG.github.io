Hey there my darling angel, hope you've had as good of a week as I have. Thanks for making my birthday so so special I don't deserve you and everything you do for me, but I do appreciate you so much. Thank you for always looking after me. You're my bester and the brightest star in my sky. I'm looking forward to so many more birthdays and memories with you. Sleep tight my angel, I love you all the way to anniesland and back so many times xxxxxx
