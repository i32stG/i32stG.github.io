title:  The Jackpot
---
Hey just there next to me my darling. Just wanted to send you a quick Friday text letting you know that I'm the luckiest boy in the world to have you as my angel, my rock and my dog momma. Lucy couldn't be any luckier to have you in her life and she's going to be so loved and looked after. Your kids at school are also the luckiest wee bawbags sweet, they don't know how much they hit the jackpot with you! I love you so mega chega much all the way to the crate in the corner at least a bajillion times. You're my angel. Sleep tight and I'm looking forward to a good weekend with my girls xxxxxx
