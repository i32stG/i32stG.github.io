Hey over there just next to me back in marywood my darling angel, I hope you've had the most amazing few days in Santorini celebrating the new Mr and Mrs Welna! What an incredible wedding with all the most incredible people that mean the world to the bride and groom. I know for me that you're my world and you're my one, I wake up every day the happiest and luckiest boy in the world and I can't wait for every moment together. You're my gypsy queen and I've never seen anything like it, the most beautiful, sexiest lady I've ever seen. I'm sorry we're both pretty ill, hopefully better soon my sweet. I love you to the moon and back so many time and also the top of the hill in Thira. Sleep tight my darling xxxxxx
