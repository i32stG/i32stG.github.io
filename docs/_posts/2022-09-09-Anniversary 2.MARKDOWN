Hey my darling angel just next to me on this very special Friday night. Tomorrow is our 2 year anniversary and I'm without a doubt the luckiest boy in the world. Thanks for always being my one, my comfort, my joy and my happiness. I don't know what I'd do without you. Can't wait to have a nice chill meal with you tomorrow and I hope we can both have a lovely day like we deserve after all the recent crazy times. I love you so mega much you're my angel, sleep tight and have lots of nice dreams xxxxxx
