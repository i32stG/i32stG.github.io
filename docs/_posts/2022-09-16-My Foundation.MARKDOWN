Hey there just next to me over here my darling angel. I just wanted to let you know that I love you and need you so so much, you're my rock and my foundation and I couldn't do it without you. Thanks for always being there for me and for inspiring me and keeping me sane. You're my one and my home. I hope you get a nice long sleep and have an amazing weekend with lots of walks for goose! I love you to the pink castle and back so many times sweet xxxxxx
