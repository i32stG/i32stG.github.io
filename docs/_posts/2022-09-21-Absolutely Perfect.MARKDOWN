---
Hey darling, hope you're doing ok over there today. I'm sad you're feeling anxious about it all, and I really do understand the pressure and the lack of appreciation from the school. Just know that you're absolutely perfect to me and I couldn't wish for a better girlfriend, dog mum and bester. You're my one xxxxxx
