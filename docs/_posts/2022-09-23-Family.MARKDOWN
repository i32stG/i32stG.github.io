Hey darling just there next to me, I just wanted to let you know that I've had such a good day with your parents (and extra people for a bit) today. Thanks for having me as part of your family, I'm such a lucky guy. You're my family and my home and my angel. I hope you know just how much you mean to me and that I couldn't do it without you. You're the best dog mum and partner and best friend I could ask for every single day. I love you to the sky and back so many times, sleep well bound my darling xxxxxx
