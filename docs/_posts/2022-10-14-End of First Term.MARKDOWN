---
Hey just there my angel. I'm so proud of you for finishing your first term. You absolutely smashed it even though it's been hard as hell, and those kids are so lucky to have you as their teacher. You're my one and my mega one, and me and Lucy are so thankful to have you in our lives. Hope you're getting a nice long sleep and are looking forward to a nice weekend with my parents aka grandma and grandad! I love you so much sweet xxxxxx
