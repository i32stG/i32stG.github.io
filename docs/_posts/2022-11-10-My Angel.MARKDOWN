Hi sweet, I hope you're getting a good sleep. Just wanted to say I really am sorry for what has happened. I am really struggling a lot at the moment whenever we have conflict since I feel very isolated without you. I think that's in part why I shut down in conflict to try to avoid it happening. I really need you and love you so so much. You are my angel and I can't imagine anyone I'd rather be having arguments with or otherwise. I love you xxxxxx
