Yeah missing you loads and loads you're my one. Let's get you home later, quick tea and beddybose! That's good to hear you have a nice lesson this morning sweet! Yes of course you can take Lucy in she will have such a good day!! Lucy is doing pretty ok over here today, I haven't noticed her biting her leg so it must have stopped irritating her, I'm sure she'll be fine. Love you so much my sweet! Xxxxxx
