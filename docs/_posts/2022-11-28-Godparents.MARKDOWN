Hey my darling I just wanted to let you know I love you so much. I'm sorry for this weekend and for my lack of communication. You deserve better than that and I need to be better for you. You're my one and my angel and there's nobody else I'd rather be a godparent with. I love you all the way to Baltimore and back so many times xxxxxx
