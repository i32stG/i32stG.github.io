title:  Keeping You Safe
---
Hey just over there my sweetness, hope you're fast asleep getting a good rest with nice dreams. Sorry for being unreliable and disrespectful with getting in touch with you. I never want that to be the case. I love you so much and I've missed you so much the past few days I've been away. Can't wait to get home to you and just keep you safe. Sorry for being a pain in the arse. You're my one. Sleep well bound my darling xxxxxxxxxxxx
